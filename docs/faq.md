# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is PyCli meant for?
PyCli is designed to be an educational tool for people interested in climate
modeling and scientific computing. It is not designed to be a competitor to
climate models written by national labs, which are far more complicated and
much more accurate.

### How accurate is PyCli?
On average, not bad! Locally, not particularly.

The PyCli climate model gives an average global temperature of 289 K
(16° C) given a CO2 concentration of 410 ppm. In 2020, the average
global temperature was 14.8° C. However, the average temperatures near
the poles are too low and the average temperatures near the equator are
higher than expected. Some of the reasons for the discrepancy is that PyCli
doesn't take into account Earth's tilt and uses a crude mechanism for
modeling heat carried by winds and ocean currents.

### I'd like to modify PyCli - is that okay?
Absolutely! The source code for PyCli is distributed under the MIT license.

### What OS do I need to run PyCli?
PyCli was built on Unix based operating systems and tested on macOS and
Ubuntu. It should work fine on these operating systems. It will *probably*
work fine on Ubuntu 20 running on Windows Subsystem for Linux, but this
hasn't been tested yet.

### I need help installing PyCli. Where can I get help?
You can post questions about PyCli on the [PyCli Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/pycli-dsl). Anything from installation questions to feature suggestions
can go there.
